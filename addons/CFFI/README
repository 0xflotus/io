03/10/2010
----------

- Added basic Byte types (like Char types) that accept numbers instead of 1-char-strings
- Added Structure and Union complex types allowing "Forward referencing"
- Added Array complex type. Allows flattening inside a Structure. Only fixed length at the moment
- Added ramdom access (read/write) to memory pointed by pointer types
- Modified Function and Library types to allow getting functions directly from a Library
- Added callback (closures) support via Function type
- Added "anonymous functions" to the Function type (that is, calling a c-function knowing its pointer and signature)
- Fixed a GC problem: types that get c-pointers from values, keep an Io reference to the value
- Pointer type casting (very basic)
- Some unit tests for Structure and Union.

TODO:

- Variable length arrays
- Stronger type/error checking
- Variadic functions
- stdcalls
- struct/union member alignment option (pack)
- 64 bit types
- More and more unit tests
- ...
