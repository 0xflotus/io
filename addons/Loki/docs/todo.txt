Loki - binary toolbox -- todo list
==================================
	
-- Refactor Assembler/CodeGenerator/Primitives
	o improve independance/reentrency of each stage (more files ?)
	o improve speed, cleanup code, compress
	
-- Add functionnality to Assembler
	o PPC assembly
	o implement x86 diassembler
	
-- Add stuff to Primitives
	o 64 bit & 128 bit SIMD support (8-128 bit integer, 32/64 bit fp)
	
-- Better interaction with C code
	o C backend to Loki primitives
	o C to Loki translation
	o C headers symbolic parser (typedefs, structs, function signatures)
	
-- Improve mapping to IoVM core 
	o Define an interface of function pointers
	o Write a set of primitives dedicated to Io (IoBridge)
	
-- Write documentation/examples
	o Use language shootout as a demonstration
	o How to write new objects
	o How to make bindings with dynamic libs
	o Documentation for the primitives & the engine internals
